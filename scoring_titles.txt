First off, this was very interesting and mostly new to me. The subject matter is a very interesting challenge and I'm thankful I got the opportunity to learn something new.
Now I'm curios about toying with these concepts, I'm basically forced by my curiosity to try to implement this anyway over the next few days :)

From what I could gather in my research and reasoning, a "broad-strokes" approach could be:

- Text preprocessing: 
      - Clean and normalize the text data: strip whitespace and punctuation, remove common stop words (eg. the, and, or, to) and convert to lowercase for consistency in processing. 
      - Stemming or lemmatization would help the subsequent processing models to better understand context by normalizing the text as much as possible. Lemmatization seems a bit more accurate.

- Feature extraction: 
    - Use feature extraction techniques like BoW or TF-IDF (BoW for analyze each book separately and TF-IDF to keep track of words across all the results) to convert
      the text into numbers that represent the weight of words in each entry.

- Processed text:
    - Based on preprocessing techniques describes above and features extracted, we should be able to predict a score for the text.
    - Consider other relevant fields like author, title, category or other Metadata:
        This could be checked against a pre-existing dataset of ours to value based on author usual subjects, their consistency.

- Readability Scores:
    - Implement Readability metrics (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level or Gunning Fog Index seem to be the most popular) to assess the complexity of the language used.

- Semantic similarity :
    - We'll have to run this scoring against a pre-existing set of rules for what we deem "important" so we can use pre-trained word embeddings to find semantic similarity between the query and results.
    - Thankfully machines don't suffer from Semantic Saturation!

- Machine learning model:
    - Train a learning-to-rank model using labeled data to combine these features and predict relevance scores.
    - I wonder - with the recent release of Llama 3.1 open source - how it would perform in this situation, given a chunky training data of already processed and scored books

- Sorting: 
    - At this point the hardest part is behind us, so we celebrate a job well done, sort by score and print to CSV accordingly


Implementation-wise, a list of possibly useful libraries would be:
  - NLTK or spaCy for text preprocessing.
  - scikit-learn for feature extraction and traditional machine learning.
  - Word2Vec, GloVe for word embeddings and sematic similarity.
  - PyTorch or TensorFlow with the transformers library for more advanced natural language processing tasks.
  - LambdaMART or RankNet as LTR models, with LightGBM or XGBoost as possible frameworks.


It's a pretty gigantic world and I had time to barely scracth the surface, so there are surely other - and possibly better - ways to approach the problem but I think - and hope - this should be exhaustive enough to give a structure to work with.
